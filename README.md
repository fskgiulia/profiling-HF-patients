# Profiling Heart Failure patients in Lombardy Region
The dataset is provided by Lombardy Region: administrative healthcare databases are created from records of service utilization and payments for payer or hospital billing purposes. Such databases contain large amounts of information on the diagnoses, procedures, resource utilization, and costs or charges of thousands (even millions) of patients. Our purpose is to:

* Identify groups of patients with different characteristics
* Analyse the additional contribution of the hospital-level features across clusters
* Study if there are differences between clusters of patients that were cured in different hospitals (effect of the hospital) using techniques such as mixed effects models

This is the final project for the course Applied Statistics held by the statistician Piercesare Secchi at Politecnico di Milano. In this project, me and my colleagues used advanced statistical tools to create clusters of patients based on health status and evaluate the performance of hospitals on each cluster of patients. 

This project was voted by professors and colleagues as the best project of the 30 groups that participated. All the code is written in R.
